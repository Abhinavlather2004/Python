I have learned Python by following the CodeWithHarry Python Course, a beginner-friendly yet comprehensive resource that helped me build a strong foundation in the language.

üß† Gained hands-on experience with core Python concepts including:

Variables, Data Types, and Operators

Conditional Statements and Loops

Functions and Recursion

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

File Handling, Exception Handling

Modules, Packages, and Virtual Environments

üîÅ Practiced and implemented all topics by writing Python scripts closely following the course structure and exercises.

This repository contains my practice scripts and mini-projects based on the lessons from the CodeWithHarry Python course.
